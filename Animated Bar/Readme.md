# Animated Bar

## Definition

Dancing bars are one of the classical components used to make a good-looking website. They are straightforward to implement and can be used as a loader or an animation while recording sound.

## Approach

The approach is to use an unordered list to create bars and then animate them using keyframes.

## HTML Code

In this section, we have created an unordered list.

## CSS Code: 

For CSS, follow these steps:
- Step 1: Align ul to the center of the page.
- Step 2: Remove all styling of the list and apply some width and height to make a bar-like shape.
- Step 3: Use keyframes to animate bars along the Y-axis. Increase the scale on the final frame to do so.
 - Step 4: Use n-th child property to apply .1s delay between each li element.
